    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
      This application is a platform for real estate listing. Users can list
      their properties and the posted properties are shown on the website. There
      is a search component where users can enter their search criteria and the
      displayed properties will change accordingly. At the bottom of the page,
      there is a pagination feature that is used to go through the displayed
      properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each property has a "Good Price", "Fair Price" or "Overpriced" badge which
      shows the value proposition of the property. if the price is more than 10%
      higher than the average price of that type of property in that city, it's
      overpriced if the price is less than 10% lower than average, it's a good
      price otherwise, it's a fair price.
